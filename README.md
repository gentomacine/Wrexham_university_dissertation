# Data-Driven Prediction of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

We apply advanced machine learning techniques to predict Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) using synthetic clinical and encounter data from the MedSynora Data Warehouse (DW). The goal is to enable early identification of individuals at risk of developing COPD through comprehensive data integration and predictive modeling.
